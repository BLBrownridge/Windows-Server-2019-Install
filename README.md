5. Once you have reached the login screen, Windows will prompt you to press CTRL+ALT+DEL. Your keyboard may not be able to  perform this command in the VM, so you'll have to use your VM software. In Oracle VM VirtualBox you navigate to the 'Input' tab to execute the CTRL+ALT+DEL command. Sign in, and congrats, you've successfully installed Windows Server 2019.
