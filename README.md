1. Select your preferred language and location, and start the installation process.

2. Opt for the "Windows Server 2019 (Desktop Experience)" with a graphical user interface (GUI) and accept the terms and conditions.

3. Choose the custom installation option and grant Windows the permissions to install on your VM.

4. Create an administrator password that is both easily memorable and secure for the purposes of this laboratory environment. As an example, you can use a password such as "Password1."

5. Once you have reached the login screen, Windows will prompt you to press CTRL+ALT+DEL. If your keyboard input does not transmit this command to the VM, utilize your VM software, such as Oracle VM VirtualBox. Within Oracle VM VirtualBox, navigate to the 'Input' tab to execute the CTRL+ALT+DEL command. Sign in, and congratulations, you have successfully installed Windows Server 2019.

Tip: Depending on the configuration of your PC, you may experience some performance issues with the VM. To enhance its smoothness, you can opt to insert the Guest Additions CD image using the 'Devices' tab. > Access your Windows VM's File Explorer. > Go to "This PC," and double-click on the "CD drive VB Guest Additions." > Execute the VBoxWindowsAdditions-amd64 file and follow the installation instructions. > Finally, reboot your Windows VM when prompted.
